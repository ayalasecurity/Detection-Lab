## Objective

Attachment Analysis: Investigate a real-world credential harvester delivered via an unusual method, where instead of using a URL in the email, a specific file type is attached.

### Skills Learned

- Analysis of attachments to identify potential threats.
- Identification and retrieval of indicators from a credential harvester delivered via unconventional methods.
- Understanding the importance of analyzing various delivery methods used by threat actors.
- Application of security principles in assessing potential risks posed by attachments in emails.

### Tools Used

- Looking in the folder for Lab 3 on the Desktop, I found the file. Right-clicking it, I went to Properties and copied the filename. Additionally, I noted the file extension, which I found to be ‘.html’ on this panel.

- I held shift and right-clicked in the folder that contained the file to select ‘Open PowerShell Window Here’. Then I used the command Get-FileHash MICRO (and pressed the Tab key to auto-complete the filename).

- I got this value by right-clicking the file, clicking Properties, then looking at the Size property.

- Based on the Website Title property and the design, this web page is imitating Microsoft's Outlook / Office365 login portal (even though the logo image isn't loading, because the lab has no internet connection).

-I could see that the email is already set in the web page as contact@securityblue.team.

- Putting the source code in CyberChef with the URL Decode operation, I could perceive the contents of the web page clearly.

- Using CTRL+F I could search for ‘logo’ and find the URL and filename needed to answer the question related.

- Opening Developer Tools and going to the Network tab, I could see any network activity on a website. Submitting the password ‘test’ resulted in the following URL being visited on a malicious domain, which is how the attacker received the credentials. Copying this value gave me the answer for the question. I noticed how the email and password were in this URL.
